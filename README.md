‚ö†Ô∏è Note that some of the materials in this tuorial are slightly out of date by now (2022), but recent feedback has shown that the tutorial is still very useful and approachable for many learners. I would like to create an updated and slightly extended version by the end of the year, but academic pressures limit my ability to work on this, so we'll have to see how it goes. ü§û (Jonas, May 22)

## Aims and Overview

This tutorial teaches the basics of bio-image processing, segmentation and analysis in python. It integrates explanations and exercises in a (hopefully) self-explanatory fashion, enabling participants to build their own image analysis pipelines step by step.

The tutorial uses single-cell segmentation of 2D confocal fluorescence microscopy images to illustrate key concepts from preprocessing to segmentation to (very basic) data analysis. It concludes with a small section on how to apply such a pipeline to multiple images at once (batch processing).

Everything you need to know to get started can be found in the jupyter notebook `image_analysis_tutorial.ipynb`. To find out more about how to run these materials interactively, see the [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Note that this tutorial was part of a course aimed at people with basic knowledge of python. The course included introductory sessions/lectures on scientific python (in particular `numpy` and `matplotlib`) as well as on image analysis (see the slides in this repository). For those tackling this tutorial on their own, it is therefore recommended to first acquire basic scientific python knowledge elsewhere (e.g. at [python-course.eu](https://www.python-course.eu)).

## Acknowledgements

The first version of this tutorial was created for the `EMBL Python Workshop - Image Processing` course organized by Karin Sasaki and Jonas Hartmann in 2016. Additional lecturers and TAs contributing to this course were Kota Miura, Volker Hilsenstein, Aliaksandr Halavatyi, Imre Gaspar, and Toby Hodges.

The second installment (the `EMBL Bio-IT Image Processing Course`, 2017) was organized and taught by Jonas Hartmann and Toby Hodges.

The third version of this tutorial was part of the `EMBL Bio-IT/ALMF Image Analysis with Python 2018` course, organized by Jonas Hartmann and Toby Hodges in collaboration with Tobias Rasse and Volker Hilsenstein. Additional organizational help came from Christian Tischer and Malvika Sharan.

Many thanks to all the helpful collaborators and the interested students who were instrumental in making these courses a success.
