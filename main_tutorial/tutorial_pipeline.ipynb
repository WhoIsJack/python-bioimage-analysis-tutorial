    "*This tutorial aims to teach the basics of (bio-)image processing with python, in particular the analysis of microscopy data in biology. It is based on an example pipeline for 2D cell segmentation and it follows a 'learning by doing' philosophy.*\n",

    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook contains detailed instructions on how to program a pipeline to segment cells in 2D microscopy images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simply go through the instructions step by step and try to implement each step as best as you can.\n",
    "    - By doing so, you will learn about key concepts of (bio-)image processing with python!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are stuck...\n",
    "    - ...first think some more about the problem and see if you can get yourself unstuck.\n",
    "    - ...search the internet (in particular StackOverflow) for a solution to your problem.\n",
    "    - ...if you are working through this tutorial in class, ask one of the tutors for help.\n",
    "    - ...if nothing else helps, you can have a look at the solutions (`tutorial_pipeline_solutions.py`) for inspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this pipeline is the *identification and segmentation of cells* in 2D confocal fluorescence microscopy images. Cell identification and segmentation are among the most common tasks in bio-image analysis and are often essential for the extraction of useful quantitative information from microscopy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is optimized to run with the provided example images, which are dual-color spinning-disc confocal micrographs (objective: 40X 1.2NA W) of cells in a live zebrafish embryo in early development (~10h post fertilization), fluorescently labeled with two membrane-localized fusion proteins."

    "- **Python legacy: integer division**\n",
    "    - Using python 2.7.x has a curious caveat: integer divisions that should result in fractions do not automatically convert to float type. For example, `3/2` will return `1` (preserving integer type) instead of the more sensible `1.5` (converting to float type). Fortunately, the improved division function of python 3 can be imported from \"the future\", see below."

Additional options emerge from combining the two: `morphological closing`, for example, is a `dilation` followed by an `erosion`.
