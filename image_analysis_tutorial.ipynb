    "##  About this Tutorial <a id=about></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "*This tutorial aims to teach the basics of (bio-)image processing with python, in particular the analysis of fluorescence microscopy data. The tutorial is self-explanatory and follows a \"learning by doing\" philosophy. It consists of step by step instructions that guide students through the construction of a 2D single-cell segmentation pipeline.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook contains detailed instructions on how to program a pipeline that can segment cells in 2D fluorescence microscopy images of a developing tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simply go through the instructions step by step and try to implement each step as best as you can.\n",
    "    - By doing so, you will learn about key concepts of (bio-)image processing with python!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are stuck...\n",
    "    - ...first think some more about the problem and see if you can get yourself unstuck.\n",
    "    - ...search the internet (in particular Stack Overflow) for a solution to your problem.\n",
    "    - ...if you are working through this tutorial in class, ask one of the tutors for help.\n",
    "    - ...if nothing else helps, you can have a look at the solutions (`image_analysis_tutorial_solutions.py`) for inspiration.\n",
    "        - **Beware:** If you simply copy a solution, you will learn *nothing* in the process! Use the solutions only as an inspiration for implementing your own version and make sure you fully understand how the solution works!\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- Some exercises are labeled as 'BONUS' exercises. It is up to you whether you'd like to complete them. \n",
    "    - If things are going slowly, you may want to skip them and come back to them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to construct a pipeline for the identification and segmentation of cells in 2D confocal fluorescence microscopy images of a tissue with labeled membranes. This is among the most common tasks in bio-image analysis and is often essential for the extraction of useful quantitative information from microscopy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is constructed based on provided example images (see `example_data` directory), which are single-color spinning-disk confocal micrographs (objective: `40X 1.2NA W`) of cells in live zebrafish embryos in early development (~10h post fertilization), fluorescently labeled with a membrane-localized fusion protein (`mNeonGreen:Ggamma9`)."

    "\n",
    "- Depending on your preferences, there are several alternatives for implementing this pipeline:\n",
    "    1. Implement it directly in this Jupyter notebook *[recommended]*.\n",
    "    2. Implement it in your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm.\n",
    "    3. Old School: Implement it in a text editor (like Vim...) and run it on the terminal.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Example Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you have downloaded the example image data (`example_cells_1.tif` and `example_cells_2.tif`), which should be located in the directory `example_data`, which in turn should be in the same directory as this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python version\n",
    "\n",
    "- The solutions are provided in **python 3.6** (but any version of python 3 should work without changes)\n",
    "- Everything shown in the solutions also works in python 2.7 with only very minor changes.\n",
    "- To install python, jupyter notebook and the required modules, we recommend the **Anaconda Distribution**. The installer can be downloaded [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required modules\n",
    "\n",

    "    - numpy\n",
    "    - scipy\n",
    "    - matplotlib\n",

    "The goal of image preprocessing is to prepare or optimize the images to make further analysis easier. Usually, this boils down to increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by removing noise and background and by enhancing structures of interest.\n",

    "The specific preprocessing steps used in a pipeline depend on the type of sample, the microscopy technique used, the image quality, and the desired downstream analysis. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deconvolution\n",
    "    - Image reconstruction based on information about the PSF of the microscope\n",
    "    - These days deconvolution is often included with microscope software\n",
    "    - *Our example images are not deconvolved, but will do just fine regardless*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conversion to 8-bit images to save memory / computational time\n",
    "    - *Our example images are already 8-bit*\n",

    "- Cropping of images to an interesting region\n",
    "    - *The field of view in our example images is fine as it is*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Smoothing of technical noise\n",
    "    - This is a very common step and usually helps to improve almost any type of downstream analysis\n",
    "    - Commonly used filters are the `Gaussian filter` and the `median filter`\n",
    "    - *Here we will be using a Gaussian filter.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Corrections of technical artifacts\n",
    "    - Common examples are uneven illumination and multi-channel bleed-through\n",
    "    - *Here we will deal with uneven signal by adaptive/local thresholding*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Background subtraction\n",
    "    - There are various ways of sutracting background signal from an image\n",
    "    - Two different types are commonly distinguished:\n",
    "        - `uniform background subtraction` treats all regions of the image the same\n",

As the water level rises, the seed expands - until it finally reaches the 'crest' of the cell membrane 'mountain range'. Here, the water would flow over into the neighboring valley, but since that valley is itself filled up with water from the neighboring cell's seed, the two water surfaces touch and the expansion stops.\n",
