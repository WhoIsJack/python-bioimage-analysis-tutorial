    "### About this Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides an introductory overview of how to approach single-cell analysis following image segmentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For people with limited experience in data analysis, this tutorial is intended as an inspiration and incentive to think about possible advanced analyses downstream of segmentation. Solving the exercises without help may be difficult, so it may be a good idea to have a look at the solutions to get some idea of how the problems should be approached. However, once the principles are understood, it is an important part of the learning experience to build your own implementation and to play around with different possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "People more experienced in data science can use this tutorial as a starting point for exploring the data analysis packages available in Python. It also illustrates that Python readily allows the construction of complete and consistent analysis pipelines, from image preprocessing to feature extraction to clustering. \n",

    "### Data Analysis with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of data analysis, machine learning, clustering and other data analysis packages for Python. The following is a list of some commonly used packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "    - Provides a dataframe object ideal for handling `sample x feature` data\n",
    "    - Most of the packages mentioned below can seamlessly work with `pandas` dataframes\n",
    "    - *Note:* the solutions to this tutorial currently do *not* use `pandas` *but will be updated to do so in the future!*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [scikit-learn (`sklearn`)](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n",
    "    - Large data analysis and machine learning package featuring many standard and state-of-the-art algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`scipy.cluster`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.html)\n",
    "    - Scipy implementation of clustering algorithms\n",

    "- [`pyMC`](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/)\n",
    "    - Package for Bayesian modeling and Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampling\n",
    "    - *Note:* this tutorial currently does *not* cover Bayesian inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these packages use `numpy` arrays (or `pandas` dataframes) to handle data, so being familiar with `numpy` is an essential prerequisite to working with any of the above. If you have completed the main tutorial, you should not have any major problems with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The following packages/modules need to be installed for this tutorial. With the exception of `tifffile`, they should all come pre-installed with the Anaconda distribution or sould be easy to install using `conda install` or `pip install`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Already needed for main tutorial**\n",
    "    - python 2.7 *(or python 3.x, if you don't mind adjusting the solutions)*\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that this tutorial is based on the segmentation and extracted measures from `example_image_1.tif` from the main pipeline. The necessary files to run the solutions are included in this directory, but it might be a bit more interesting for you to use the results of your own work."

Be sure to use a data type that works for all the different types of features you are using. If you are using numpy arrays, it makes sense to also keep a list of column labels (names of the features) and row labels (cell IDs) because the array itself is unlabeled.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Hint 2:** It can be advantageous to use measures that are largely independent of cell size (or normalized for cell size) to prevent cell size from dominating the different features. Of course, cell size itself should be a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hint 3:** Don't forget that we also identified the boundaries of each cell in the main script. Importing or reconstructing this data here may be useful for the calculation of various features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hint 4:** Make sure you visualize your data!\n",
    "    - It can be very useful to have a look at what a feature looks like when mapped to the actual image (using a semi-transparent overlay, see section 'Expansion by Watershed' in the main tutorial). \n",
    "    - This may already show interesting patterns, or should at least confirm that the extracted values are consistent with the feature's rationale.\n",
